I did a sound design for video work "under city" for artist team SIDE CORE.

{{< youtube 9F0JAFI-LBk>}}

This work was presented at the empty space next to Meguro Kansokui in Tokyo, as "rode work ver. under city" as an outcome of Civic Creative Base Tokyo Felloship Program 2023. Also exhibited at "Intesecting Perceptions" exhibition in MEET YOUR ART FESTIVAL 2023.

Then, the works was revised as an multi-channel video works in their solo exhibition at Watarium Museum "Concrete Planet". The sound was also re-designed as an multi-channel audio version.
