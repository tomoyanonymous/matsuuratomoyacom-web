This project, VisVib, is a system that uses an instrument called tone chimes to experience sound as light and video.
It was developed during the process of creating music workshops that can be enjoyed by deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals, in collaboration with Civic Creative Base Tokyo (CCBT), Tokyo University of the Arts Art Media Center (AMC), and Tokyo Bunka Kaikan.
