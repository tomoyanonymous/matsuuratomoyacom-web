> The installation will give you an interactive experience and artistic performance of Yakusugi tree table.
We invite visitors to feel the flow of the eternal time in Yakushima by projecting images and movements directly on the wood grain pattern, where Yakusugi reflects its own beautiful and special pattern created by nature.

The composition itself and the actual programming is tottaly combined. Most part of the music is generated in real time and with 4ch surround system.

The software was developed with Cycling' 74 Max and Faust Language. The composition contains writing algorithms of synthesizers from scratch.
