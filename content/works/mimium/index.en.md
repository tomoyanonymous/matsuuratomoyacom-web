mimium (MInimal-Musical-medIUM) is a programming language for sound and music. Designed and developed with the aim of serving not only as a tool for musicians and programmers but also as an infrastructure for music creation and distribution, mimium distinguishes itself in its capabilities.

mimium is a functional programming language based on lambda calculus, a universal computational system, enhanced with minimal primitives for temporal operations (delays and feedback). This design allows users to define fundamental signal processing units, like oscillators and filters, as just functions within the mimium language, distinguishing it from many existing sound programming environments. The benefits of lambda calculus enable meta-operations, making it straightforward to replicate functions such as oscillators in arbitrary numbers (e.g., 100 or 1000 instances), an operation that is often challenging to implement concisely in other languages.

Also mimium has a unique Live Coding feature. By doing static analysis of diff of the codes, regardless of the part of DSP, the player can continue the performance without audio interruption.
