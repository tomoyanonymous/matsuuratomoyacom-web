## Abstract

This paper investigates the concept and development of Bio-Sonic Sense, an artistic interpretation of bio sonars, as an attempt to create a cross-species experience. It examines the potential of sensory transformation through technology-specifically, transcoding visual to audio-with the purpose of communicating the mechanisms of ultrasonic communication employed by marine mammals. Bio-Sonic sense is the result of using artistic practice and critical play, in order to disseminate the effects of noise pollution on marine life. This paper proposes that those practices should be explored as methods that can design for the use of technics as tools that can expand the human senses, thus allowing the exploration of non-human “worlds”.
