# Tomoya Matsuura Artist Statement

(Jan,2019)

**Tomoya Matsuura** (Fukuoka, Japan) is a sound artist who builds systems that describe and generate sound. These take the form of music, sound installations, and instruments.

His curiosity is not a sound itself but a system that describes and generates the sound. While he uses programming for varying purposes from a signal processing to a composition, he also makes an analog electronic circuit and primitive digital logic circuits because his works sometimes give a question to existing digital formats itself which we treat in a programming usually.

Feedback systems are a crucial part of the works because they behave like both stable and unstable from similar structures.

Tomoya is particularly inspired by the work of [Paul DeMarinis](http://pauldemarinis.org) which rethinks failed and obsolete technologies and media, and media-archaeological studies. He also uses obsolete technologies in his work such as acoustic memory delay and Whirlwind to ask the questions: Why did these technologies die? How could they be reinvented in today’s context?

This exploration is a combination of social and technical curiosity.

Making tools, is a kind of meta-creation. It is attractive that tool-maker can step into a deep part of a history of expressions. On the other hand, it also has a political effect that tool-maker can dominate and control its users, regardless its first philosophy. Tomoya considers, in fact, softwares for musical creation and distributing platforms of music are limiting other possible choices of creations and auditions.

Tomoya is interested in rethinking and resisting fixed and standardized formats such as a musical notation, computer architecture, and data structure, and to continue to propose alternative possibilities.
